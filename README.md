# TRG-Regional-Seismic-Workflow
Toolbox for seismic risk and damage assessment of buildings and infrastructure at regional scales

## Domain Reduction Method (DRM) & Perfectly Matched Layer
The DRM codes are written in Matlab and can calculate the equivalent nodal forces complied to ABAQUS keyword syntax. The PML codes are written in Fortran and can be used as a user-defined element (UEL) in ABAQUS Standard. 

The coupled DRM-PML system is a powerful computational tool for soil-structure interaction, wave propagation, moving load on half-space analyeses, and many other applications in Civil Engineering.
